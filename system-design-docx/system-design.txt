System Design Document

Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application with user authentication, chat, and session management capabilities. It includes a React frontend and a choice of Node.js (recommended) or Python Django for the backend, supported by a MongoDB or PostgreSQL/SQLite database.

1. Technologies and Frameworks

    Frontend: React
        1. React is chosen for its component-based architecture, making it well-suited for a dynamic UI with reusable elements.
        2. React Testing Library and Jest are used for testing, enabling a test-driven development approach that improves component reliability and ensures the UI meets expected behaviors.

    Backend (Recommended): Node.js with Express
        1. Node.js is used for backend development, offering an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which is efficient for real-time applications.
        2. Express is a lightweight, flexible web application framework for Node.js, streamlining routing, middleware, and server handling.
        3. SQL is the preferred database due to its schema-less nature, making it highly adaptable to changing data requirements, which is ideal for real-time chat applications.

    Alternative Backend: Python Django
        1. Django is used as an alternative backend option for applications requiring a more structured and “batteries-included” framework.
        2. Django REST Framework (DRF) facilitates rapid API development and simplifies serialization and authentication mechanisms.
        3. PostgreSQL is chosen as a primary database for Django, as it supports ACID transactions and offers reliable data integrity, or SQLite for lightweight applications or prototyping.

    Security Libraries
        1. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for session management and authentication in both backend options to securely handle user sessions.
        2. Bcrypt: A hashing library for securely storing passwords, adding a layer of protection against common security threats.

    Assumptions
        1. Real-Time Requirements: This project assumes a moderate level of real-time requirements, especially for chat, and relies on WebSockets for efficient real-time messaging.
        2. Single-Instance Backend: Assumes initial deployment may be on a single backend instance, scalable in the future to multiple instances.
        3. User Load: Initial user load is expected to be manageable on a single database instance, with plans for database replication or sharding for scaling.

2. Considerations
    1. Scalability
        1. Stateless Backend: By making the backend stateless with token-based authentication (JWT), it allows horizontal scaling, as each instance can independently validate requests.
        2. WebSocket Connections: Real-time chat is managed through WebSockets, with a WebSocket server capable of scaling horizontally if user demand increases.
        3. Database: MongoDB supports sharding, enabling distributed storage across clusters, while PostgreSQL can be configured for read replicas to handle heavy read loads.
        4. Frontend Optimization: Using lazy loading and code-splitting in React ensures that only essential components load on the initial page, improving the user experience as demand grows.

    2. Security
        1. JWT Expiration and Refresh Tokens: Short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens provide secure user sessions while mitigating risks associated with token theft.
        2. Password Hashing with Bcrypt: Passwords are hashed with Bcrypt, ensuring secure storage of user credentials in the database.
        3. Data Validation and Sanitization: Both frontend and backend validate inputs to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection attacks and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        4. Environment Variables: Sensitive information such as database URIs and API secrets are stored securely in environment variables.

    3. Maintainability
        1. Component-Based Design: React's component architecture supports isolated, reusable components that are easy to maintain and extend.
        2. Modular Backend Structure: Following a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in both Express and Django ensures that code is organized, making it easier to troubleshoot, update, and add new features.
        3. Comprehensive Testing: Automated testing at both the unit and integration levels for frontend and backend components increases system reliability and eases future modifications.
        4. Documentation and Version Control: The codebase is documented, and changes are tracked via version control, allowing new developers to onboard quickly and understand the project structure.

3. Design Choices
    3.1 Database Design
        MongoDB (for Node.js): Collections are used for users and messages, with a schema that can adapt to changes in user attributes or message metadata.
        PostgreSQL (for Django): Relational tables handle complex relationships, with structured data that supports ACID compliance for reliable transactions.
    3.2 Authentication & Authorization
        JWT for Authentication: Access tokens allow secure API access for authenticated users, and refresh tokens are used to maintain session longevity.
        Role-Based Access Control: Roles can be added for different user permissions, enabling fine-grained access control for specific features (e.g., admin vs. standard users).
    3.3 Real-Time Chat
        WebSocket Implementation: A WebSocket server manages bi-directional communication for real-time message exchange, with connection handling for multiple users.
    3.4 Deployment Considerations
        Docker for Containerization: Docker allows consistent deployments across development, staging, and production environments.
        Load Balancing: Load balancers will distribute traffic across multiple server instances as user demand increases, ensuring consistent performance.
